			<h4>Fire Emblem</h4>
			<p>Fire Emblem is a turn base stragety game that is made by Nintendo.
				I only started playing it for a year but I got to say one of my favorite games of all time.
				The game franchise had its 30th anniversary and because of that the first fire emblem which was only released in Japan is getting an english release.</p>
			<h4>Super Smash Bros Ultimate</h4>
			<p>Super Smash Bros Ultimate or SSBU is somewhat a party game that can be taken seriously as an esport.
				Your main goal in this game is to knock your opponent off the stage and making them lose all of their stocks(lives).
				Each time you hit the opponent it increases their precent, the higher their percent is then the more they are knocked back.
				If the opponent is high enough percent you can hit them with a strong move to make them fly off the screen or you can protect the stage and make it so that they cannot make back on stage.</p>
			<h4>Destiny 2</h4>
			<p>Destiny 2 is a looter made by Bungie, the same people who made the first three halo games.
				This is game there isn't a certain goal, just get stronger to do end game activities like the raids and nightfalls.
				A raid is a 6 man activity with different encounters, usually is just killing bosses that drop good loot,
				but there are some raids that there might be an encounter where it is entirely mechanics where you have to do certain things in order to beat it.</p>
